# Kanban Board Application

This project is a feature-rich Kanban board application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It allows users to manage tasks across multiple columns, with drag-and-drop functionality, search capabilities, and undo/redo features.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/kanban-board.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd kanban-board`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser


Technology Choices and Rationale:

1. Next.js: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, optimized performance, and excellent developer experience.
2. React: Used for building a dynamic and responsive user interface with reusable components.
3. TypeScript: Adds static typing to improve code quality, catch errors early, and enhance developer productivity.
4. Zustand: A lightweight state management solution that simplifies global state handling compared to more complex solutions like Redux.
5. @hello-pangea/dnd: Provides smooth drag-and-drop functionality specifically designed for React applications.
6. Tailwind CSS: Utilized for rapid UI development with utility-first CSS, ensuring consistency across the application.
7. shadcn/ui: Offers accessible and customizable UI components built on top of Radix UI.


Known Limitations/Trade-offs:

1. Local Storage: While simple to implement, it limits data persistence to a single device and browser.
2. Performance with Large Datasets: May face issues with a very large number of cards or columns.
3. Limited Collaboration Features: Lacks real-time collaboration or user authentication.
4. Browser Compatibility: Relies on modern browser features, potentially limiting compatibility with older browsers.
5. Offline Functionality: Basic offline support due to local storage, but lacks robust offline-to-online syncing.


Future Improvements:

1. Backend Integration: Implement a server with a database for better data management and multi-user support.
2. Real-time Collaboration: Add WebSocket support for live updates across multiple users.
3. User Authentication: Implement user accounts for personalized boards and improved security.
4. Advanced Search: Enhance search with filters, tags, and full-text capabilities.
5. Performance Optimization: Implement virtualization for efficient handling of large datasets.
6. Mobile App: Develop a dedicated mobile application for improved mobile experience.
7. Customization Options: Allow users to customize colors, labels, and board layouts.
8. Data Export/Import: Add features for backing up and sharing board data.
9. Integrations: Develop integrations with popular productivity tools.
10. Accessibility Improvements: Conduct an accessibility audit and implement necessary improvements.
11. Robust Offline Mode: Implement advanced offline support with efficient data syncing.
12. Analytics: Add usage tracking to identify areas for improvement.
